   @defgroup GridPart View of grid for defining discrete functions
   @ingroup FEM 

   Grid parts allow to define a view on a given dune grid, treating
   the underlying grid as a container for entities. 
   
   All parts of the dune-fem package rely on 
   grid parts to access
   the entities of the grid, e.g., discrete functions are defined on
   the set of entities accesseable by the given GridPart implementation
   by using the iterator and index set provided by the GridPart.

   \remark 
   The interface and some basic implementations are
   provied in the dune-grid package.

   Functions are mappings from one finite
   dimensional vector space into another, e.g.,
   \f$K^n\f$ into \f$L^m\f$ where
   \f$K\f$ and \f$L\f$ are fields.
   They are therefore special instances of
   general vector space \ref Mapping "mappings".

   The domain and the range are defined by 
   a \ref Dune::FunctionSpaceInterface "function space".
   
   \ref Dune::DiscreteFunctionInterface "Discrete function" 
   are special functions defined on a grid and
   belong to corresponding 
   \ref Dune::DiscreteFunctionSpaceInterface "discrete function space".
