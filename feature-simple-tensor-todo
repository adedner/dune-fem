massoperator is testbasis for all further ideas

1) simple tensors
  - ZeroTensor should be actively used.
  - caching ?

2) lifted quadratures 
  - Martin will do it, Facade Class + Caching

3) new model interface,
  - local initialize
  - chached object testing

Problems:
1) LiftedQuadrature cannot be created for each entity, because it contains
   a std::vector to cache the weights.

   Possible resolutions:
   - do not cache
   - revise quadrature interface to use an init technique:
       CachingQuadrature< GP, 0 > quadrature;
       quadrature.init( entity, order );

       CachingQuadrature< GP, 1 > quadrature( gridPart, inside );
       quadrature.init( intersection, order );
