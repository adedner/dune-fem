25.01.2010: Fem::Function no longer stores a function space.

            The reference to a function space has been removed from
            Fem::Function. Along with it, the method space and the old
            constructor have been deprecated. Functions are now created
            by the default constructor.

            Note: The type FunctionSpaceType within the discrete function
            spaces is now an actual FunctionSpace. Many dune-fem codes
            assumed FunctionSpaceType and DiscreteFunctionSpaceType to be
            equal. This is no longer true.

25.01.2010: Moved Function into namespace Dune::Fem

	    dune-common also contains a Function, now. To resolve the name
            clash, dune-fem declares its function in the namespace Dune::Fem
            now.

            Note: This is a subtle change. The compiler errors will not be
            very clear.
