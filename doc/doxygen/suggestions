 *
 *  \section before1 ... that Should Be Implemented Before 1.0
 *
 *  - DisceteFunction :: FunctionSpaceType should be the underlying
 *    function space (and not the discrete function space)
 *
 *  - Implement a quadrature interface (using Barton-Nackman trick). This would
 *    allow the operator[] to be default implemented.
 *
 *  - Either remove the \\hasdefault mark for documentation, or use it
 *    consequently.
 *  .
 *
 *  \section after1 ... that Should Be Implemented After 1.0
 *
 *  - Have a stack of discrete functions (which might be cleared on adaption
 *    and limited to hold only a small number of discrete functions)
 *  .
 *
 *  \section brainstorm ... that Might Be of Interest
 *
 *  - Make LocalFunctionStorages singleton
 *
 *  - Add a LocalFunctionSpace to discrete function spaces. This way, some
 *    specializations need not be done in the local function. The local
 *    function space should at least provide the following features:
 *    - the base function set
 *    - the entity
 *    - a method mapToGlobal
 *    .
 *    Then, the localFunction method on the discrete function can be called
 *    with the local function space. Therefore, the base function set and the
 *    Dof mappings need only be fetched once (the caching part could even be
 *    done in a wrapper).
