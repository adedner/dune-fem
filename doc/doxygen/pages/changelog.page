/** \page ChangeLog Change Log
 *
 *  The change log lists the major steps taken between the different releases.
 *
 *  \section first Changes from 0.9.1 to 0.10
 *  - Lagrange base functions have been fixed.
 *  .
 *  \section second Changes from 0.9.1 to 0.9.2
 *  - Pass now has 3rd template argument passId, which is by default set to
 *    -1
 *  - in addition to new Pass, new CreatePass isn't compatible any more 
 *    with old passes. To plug a pass into new CreatePass one must use new Pass
 *  - in addition to new Pass, class Selector that is given to the class
 *    DiscreteModelCaller as a third template parameter, has to be wrapped 
 *    by CombinedSelector< ThisType , Selector >, and then the class
 *    DiscreteModelCaller must take this wrapper instead of the class Selector
 *  .
 *  \section third Changes from 0.9 to 0.9.1
 *  - The evaluation methods taking a Quadrature and an int as arguments are
 *    now mere fronts for the evaluate methods taking a PointType.
 *  - Local functions now use an \ref EngineConcept "engine concept".
 *  - The method scalarProductDofs in \ref Dune::Fem::DiscreteFunctionInterface
 *    "discrete functions" is now parallelized (do not communicate afterwards).
 *  - Communication managers now support different communication operations
 *    (i.e., copy, add, etc.) and different communication interfaces and
 *    directions. Communication of higher codims should also work.
 *  .
 *	\section fourth Changes from 1.2.1 to 1.3.0
 *  - The whole module has moved to namespace Fem.
 *	- The new \ref Dune::Fem::CombinedDiscreteFunctionSpace is implemented to generate a 
 *		\ref Dune::Fem::DiscreteFunctionInterface out of two arbitrary Spaces.
 *	-	new gridParts are implemented, idGridPart, geoGridPart and filteredGridPart.
 *	- In 2D \ref Dune::Fem::LagrangeDiscreteFunctionSpace are available with polynomial
 *	  order >3 even if the grid is not twist free.
 *	- The dofMapper is equiped with a method called mapEach, which performs a functor
 *	  application on each tuple of ( localDof, globalDof ).
 *	.
 *	\section fives Changes from 1.3.* to 1.4.0
 *	- The concept of shape functions (basis functions on the reference element) is introduced and included. Expression templates
 *	are used to handle vectorial basis function sets efficiently.
 *	-	The object \ref Dune::Fem::Stencil is introduced, which holds the sparsity pattern of the system matrix.
 *	-	The \ref Dune::Fem::PetscDiscreteFunction is introduced, providing bindings to the software packageg PETsc. PETsc can now be used as another solver library.
 *  - New DiscreteFunctionSpace implementations have been added, see \ref DiscreteFunctionSpace for further details.
 *	.
