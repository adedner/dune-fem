\page DocRules Some basic remark concerning documentation
<!---------------------------------------------->
In the following some remarks on how to add to the
doxygen documentation of dune-fem. 
Details on doxygen can be found on the doxygen
homepage (see link at bottom of each page).
Warning concerning faullty documentation are
recored in dune-fem/doc/doxygen.out this file
should be empty...

- Mathematical formulas can be inserted into the
  documentation quite easily using a latex style
  notation.
- References to other classes or groups are
  automatically inserted if the name of the
  class or group is used in the text. \n
  Specific references can be added using
  the \\ref command followed by the text
  which should be highlighted using quotes ("..."). 
- The documentation of a class, typedefs, members
  etc. always proceed the actual statement in the
  code. 
- For deprecated members the command 
  \\deprecated should be included in the documentation.
  For deprecated files the \\depricated command can
  be inserted into a file documentation.
  All thus marked block will be linked into a related
  page.
- A new implementation can be marked and thus be
  easier to find by adding \\newimplementation
  into the documentation. Again a related page
  is generated linking all new classes.
.

The following are of course only guidlines - please
add to them.
<!---------------------------------------------->
\section DocGroups Grouping documentation
All groups are defined in the fem/modules 
file using \\defgroup; subgrouping is done
by adding \\ingroup.
The order of these group definitions determins
the order in which the groups appear in the modules
page of the documentation.
Only the major groups which have no obvious class
attached to them are documented in the modules file.
All others are just declared.
Their documentation should be in some obvious header
file for example before the namespace Dune is oppened
or directly following.  
Proceed the documentation by
\\addtogroup Groupname 

If a group combines all implementations for
a spesific interface then the documentation for
the group should be in the header containing the
interface class and the documentation should 
refere to this interface class, e.g.,
\\remark The interface is defined through the class InterfacClass

Class that should appear direcly on the page with
the group documentation, e.g., all implementation
classes (if they do not belong to a subgroup)
should have a \\ingroup GroupName in the
documentation of the class.
It probably better to have a very short \\brief 
documentation for these classes since this
appears on the module page.
After the \\brief statements a detailed documentation
follows after a blank line.

Important classes - either from the user
or the implementers point of view - that just to seem to fit anywhere can
be added to the group HelperClasses or else 
not included in any group; they will always
appear in the class list of the documentation.

Depricated classes or methods should be 
tagged with a \\depricated command in the documentation
followed by a short remark on the reason for
removing this part of the code or alternatives 
enclosed in quotes.
<!---------------------------------------------->

<!---------------------------------------------->
\section DocInterfaces Documentation of interface classes
<!---------------------------------------------->
All methods and typedefs should be documented using \\brief.
For the methods the arguments and the return type
should be documented using
- \\param[in] for input parameters,
- \\param[out] for return value parameters,
- \\return for the return value.

For the typedefs a reference to a corresponding
interface class for this type should be included -
if one exists. For example using the \\ref
command:
\\ref MappingInterface "mapping type".

For methods which are implemented in a corresponding
default class the command \\hasdefault should be
added at the end of the member documentation.



<!---------------------------------------------->
\section DocImplementation Documentation of implementation classes
<!---------------------------------------------->
By using the copydoc command the documentation
from the interface class can be repeated in the
implementation class:
//! \\brief \@copydoc KlassenNameOhneTemplates::funktionOhneParameter 
*/
