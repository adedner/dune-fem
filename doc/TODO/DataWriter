A) data_ set in constructor and data passed in write
   method very inconsistenly used (e.g. vtkWriter)
   No DataTuple in constructor needed?

1) seperate grape output (call it different anyway)
   from meare visualization output for paraview
   It is impossible to use the DataWriter with 
   a function, which has no read/write method 
   (e.g. Adpators)
2) A specialized version (e.g. for the howto)
   taking a single function would be nice.
3) It should be possible to set some parameters 
   (e.g. filename) not only through the paramerfile
   but also in the program itself dynamicaly
   and perhaps also to change the stepCounter and
   force writting (override willWrite)
