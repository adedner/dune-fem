1) Move pass to operator
2) Restructure:
   i) Basics: StartPass, Pass, LocalPass and
              the unspecific part of ModelCaller
              (template magic with selector,
               handling DiscreteFunctionTuples)
  ii) Implementations: DGPass+DGModelCaller,...
                       and example DiscreteModels
3) A InsertOperatorPass:
   Given some OperatorImplementation Op we need
   a mechanism to add it to a pass tree.
   We have v=Op(u) and through some Model Op
   depends on some other data function 
   (e.g. viscosity tensor A(s))
   These data function could now depend on 
   the results from previous passes:
   v=Op(u,u_1,u_2.,...,u_k)
   Prehaps we need Operator with more than one
   argument - prehaps use the technique with
   Tuples of DiscreteFunctions as used in the
   ModelCaller
