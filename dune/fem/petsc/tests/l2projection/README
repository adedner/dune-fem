This is essentially the l2projection from the dune-fem-howto (as of r647)
with 2 minor changes:

1) The PetscDiscreteFunction does not support adaption yet. So we destroy
   and re-create a new PetscDiscreteFunction in each EOC step.

2) After MPIManager::initialize, we call Dune::Petsc::initialize. This is required
   to set up the handling of PETSc errors. And before the program terminates, we
   call Dune::Petsc::finalize.
