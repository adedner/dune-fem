1) moving to namespace Dune::Fem finalized 

2) DiscreteFunctionSpaces / DofMapper:
    - new local 'interpolation' method on spaces
    - New spaces:
      - HierarchicLegendreDiscontinuousGalerkinSpace
      - GenericDiscreteFunctionSpace
      - FouierDiscreteFunctionSpace
      - RannacherTurekDiscreteFunctionSpace (dune-localfunctions is required)
    - transition to BlockMapper is finished

3) ShapeFunctionSets / Basis/BaseFunctionSets 
    - Introduction of ShapeFunctionSets, basis function sets on reference elements
    - renamed: BaseFunctionSet -> BasisFunctionSets
    - Introduction of MakeVectorialExpression to handle efficiently vectorial shapefunctionsets,
      expression tamplates are used

3) GridParts / Parallel:
    - each gridpart provides access to the underlaying communiction manager, gridPart.comm()
    - HierarchicGridPart has been deprecated
    - MPIHelper and its header mpihelper.hh is removed, use MPIManager from  mpimanager.hh instead
    - SMP???

4) Operators / Solvers:
    - Introduction of stencil objects holding the sparsity pattern
    - Indroduction of new LinearOperator classes for ISTL-, PETsc- and Adaptivfunctions
    - Introduction of LocalColumnObjects in the matrix implementation
    - added binding to PETsc as a new solver library
    - improved UMFPACK binding

5) misc:
  - support for gcc-4.7, gcc-4.8, icpc (not tested) and clang (not tested)
  - support for BlueGene arcitectures is improved
  - Dune::Fem::Tuples are replaced by Dune::tuples
  - further functionality for Dune::tuples is added ( eg. push_front)
  - Error computation is replaced by the corresponding norms, eg. L2Error -> L2Norm
  - binarydataio.hh has been deprecated
