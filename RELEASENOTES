Recend changes:

1) The whole model has moved to namespace Fem.

2) Different new gridParts haven been implemented
   such as idGridPart, geoGridPart and fliteredGridPart.

3) Lagrange Function space in 2D are avilable for polinomial order >3 even if the grid
   is not twist free.   

4) Each dofmapper is delivered with a mapEach function.

5) In the future basefunctionsets will not provide the methods evaluate, jacobian,
   hessian for a single basefunction, therefor this methods are marked deprecated.

6) A new CombinedDiscreteFuncitonSpace is implemented, which generates a
   DiscreteFunctionSpace from two arbitrary DiscreteFunctionSpaces.
